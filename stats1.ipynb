    "test, which are suitable for ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful Interpretation: The level of measurement influences the interpretation of the data. Different levels provide different levels of \n",

    "and communicating the results.\n",
    "Example: Consider a Likert scale survey question asking respondents to rate their agreement with a statement on a scale of 1 to 5 (1=Strongly\n",
    "Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree). If the scale is treated as interval data, it might be tempting to compute an average score. However, \n",
